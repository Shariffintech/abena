        <p>
          At Abena, our goal is to help our teachers be thoughtful and
          intentional as they support the academic, social emotional,
          developmental and behavioral needs of children in their classroom.
          We have discovered an ideal way to build a product that resonates
          with this mission and have developed a roadmap to attend to the
          unique needs and interactions among children, teachers, parents and
          community-based partners. Abena DMS is a clever tool used to boost
          data-driven decision making and demystifying complexities of using
          SEL, PBIS. RTI and MTSS in the classroom. This integrated approach
          for supporting children encourages all team members to streamline
          communication and easily pick-up dialogue where each use may leave
          off. By simplifying methods for gathering, analyzing and storing
          critical data, child outcomes may be improved.

          A few specific area we're elevating in our system is how to
          proactively support the needs of all children and rapidly respond
          when a concern arises while keeping all stakeholders involved along
          the way! Stay informed with the launch of Abena DMS in 2022 and the
          next phase of education.
